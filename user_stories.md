##As a developer, I would like to...
    - select 3 random images and place them side by side.
    - make it to be able to receive and track amount of clicks for each image.
    - track how many times each image is displayed.
    - make sure the 3 images contain no duplicates, nor they are immediately repeated from the last click.
    - make a constructor function that creates an object associated w/ each image, and has properties such as:
        - name of the image
        - filepath
        - number of times it has been shown
